NSA

-----------------------

This is a birthday present I made for my partner. We couldn't remember what the acronym NSA (National Security Agency) stood
for, so we started making things up, like "Nuclear Seahorse Armada," "Narming Snarfing Allosaurus," etc. This became a 
recurring word game between us. I created this script to scrape all words beginning with "N," "S," and "A" from the web and 
determine the part of speech of each word using an online dictionary, creating a dictionary. This dictionary is used by the
second part of the script to create random acronym solutions using the part of speech. User input allows for several custom
features including a definition fetcher and a custom dictionary.

As this was created over the course of a few nights while I was in a hotel overseas, it is designed to be maximally functional
with minimal effort, and could use many improvements. I will be updating this script occasionally to make it easier to read and 
more user friendly, and to make the randomly generated acronyms better. I may also add features if I'm feeling frisky.
